# SE_577
Cloud native frontend to GitHub designed for SE577 under Dr. Filippos Vokolos.

Created by Philip Jones, CS student at Drexel University. When I'm not in class, I enjoy reading Linux man pages, debugging multi-threaded processes, and coding in whitespace-only languages. My other interests include debating freshman on why UML arrows go FROM dependant objects TO dependencies.

Jokes aside, I'm excited to learn more about software architecture. So much of CS is myopically focused on algorithmic analysis and performance, whereas much of the effectiveness of software comes from it's overall design and the soft skill of requirement elicitation. Excited to build an end-to-end application to learn the whole process!

I'd like to get hands-on experience and make some of the mistakes that are inevitable on the path to becoming a good software architect.
